	a normalized microRNA signal useful for the statistical analysis,
	AgiMicroRna offers the possibility of employing either the processed
	signal estimated by the robust multiarray average algorithm or the
	processed signal produced by the Agilent image analysis software.
	The AgiMicroRNA package also incorporates different graphical utilities

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: An increasingly common application of gene expression
	profile data is the reverse engineering of cellular networks. However,
	common procedures to normalize expression profiles generated using
	the Affymetrix GeneChips technology were originally developed for
	a rather different purpose, namely the accurate measure of differential
	gene expression between two or more phenotypes. As a result, current
	evaluation strategies lack comprehensive metrics to assess the suitability
	of available normalization procedures for reverse engineering and,
	in general, for measuring correlation between the expression profiles
	of a gene pair. RESULTS: We benchmark four commonly used normalization
	procedures (MAS5, RMA, GCRMA and Li-Wong) in the context of established
	algorithms for the reverse engineering of protein-protein and protein-DNA
	interactions. Replicate sample, randomized and human B-cell data
	sets are used as an input. Surprisingly, our study suggests that
	MAS5 provides the most faithful cellular network reconstruction.
	Furthermore, we identify a crucial step in GCRMA responsible for
	introducing severe artifacts in the data leading to a systematic
	overestimate of pairwise correlation. This has key implications not
	only for reverse engineering but also for other methods, such as
	hierarchical clustering, relying on accurate measurements of pairwise
	expression profile correlation. We propose an alternative implementation
	to eliminate such side effect.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous and highly aggressive
	malignancy, for which there are no effective cures. Identification
	of a malignant stemlike subtype of HCC may offer patients with a
	dismal prognosis a potential targeted therapy using c-MET and Wnt
	pathway inhibitors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show promise as diagnostic
	and prognostic tools for cancer detection and stratification. Using
	a TRE-c-Met-driven transgenic HCC mouse model, we identified a cluster
	of 23 miRNAs that is encoded within the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinted region
	on chromosome 12qF1 overexpressed in all of the isolated liver tumors.
	Interestingly, this region is conserved among mammalian species and
	maps to the human DLK1-DIO3 region on chromosome 14q32.2. We thus
	examined the expression of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster in a cohort
	of 97 hepatitis B virus-associated HCC patients and identified a
	subgroup (n = 18) of patients showing strong coordinate overexpression
	of miRNAs in this cluster but not in other cancer types (breast,
	lung, kidney, stomach, and colon) that were tested. Expression levels
	of imprinted gene transcripts from neighboring loci in this 14q32.2
	region and from a subset of other imprinted sites were concomitantly
	elevated in human HCC. Interestingly, overexpression of the DLK1-DIO3
	miRNA cluster was positively correlated with HCC stem cell markers
	(CD133, CD90, EpCAM, Nestin) and associated with a high level of
	serum alpha-fetoprotein, a conventional biomarker for liver cancer,
	and poor survival rate in HCC patients. In conclusion, our findings
	suggest that coordinate up-regulation of the DLK1-DIO3 miRNA cluster
	at 14q32.2 may define a novel molecular (stem cell-like) subtype
	of HCC associated with poor prognosis.},

	To understand the biology of cancer, it is thus important to look
	at the activation state of key proteins and signaling networks. The
	limited amount of available sample material from patients and the
	complexity of protein expression patterns make the use of traditional
	protein analysis methods particularly difficult. In addition, the
	only approach that is currently available for performing functional
	studies is the use of serial biopsies, which is limited by ethical
	constraints and patient acceptance. The goal of this work was to
	establish a 3-D ex vivo culture technique in combination with reverse-phase
	protein microarrays (RPPM) as a novel experimental tool for use in
	cancer research. The RPPM platform allows the parallel profiling
	of large numbers of protein analytes to determine their relative
	abundance and activation level. Cancer tissue and the respective
	corresponding normal tissue controls from patients with colorectal
	cancer were cultured ex vivo. At various time points, the cultured
	samples were processed into lysates and analyzed on RPPM to assess
	the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 24 proteins
	involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The methodology displayed
	good robustness and low system noise. As a proof of concept, CEA
	expression was significantly higher in tumor compared with normal
	tissue (p<0.0001). The caspase 9 expression signal was lower in tumor
	tissue than in normal tissue (p<0.001). Cleaved Caspase 8 (p=0.014),

	cleaved PARP (p=0.007) were differentially expressed in normal liver
	and normal colon tissue. We demonstrate here the feasibility of using
	RPPM technology with 3-D ex vivo cultured samples. This approach
	is useful for investigating complex patterns of protein expression
	and modification over time. It should allow functional proteomics
	in patient samples with various applications such as pharmacodynamic

	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.

	it is necessary to compare biological models with measured data.
	This allows the identification of new models and new insights into
	existing ones.We present MGV, a versatile generic graph viewer for
	multiomics data. MGV is integrated into Mayday (Battke et al., 2010).
	It extends Mayday's visual analytics capabilities by integrating
	a wide range of biological models, high-throughput data and meta
	information to display enriched graphs that combine data and models.
	A wide range of tools is available for visualization of nodes, data-aware
	graph layout as well as automatic and manual aggregation and refinement
	of the data. We show the usefulness of MGV applied to several problems,
	including differential expression of alternative transcripts, transcription
	factor interaction, cross-study clustering comparison and integration
	of transcriptomics and metabolomics data for pathway analysis.MGV
	is a open-source software implemented in Java and freely available
	as a part of Mayday at www.microarray-analysis.org/mayday.symons@informatik.uni-tuebingen.deSupplementary
	data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	GeneChip arrays appear to dominate this market. These arrays use
	short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Due to
	optical noise, nonspecific hybridization, probe-specific effects,
	and measurement error, ad hoc measures of expression that summarize
	probe intensities can lead to imprecise and inaccurate results. Various
	researchers have demonstrated that expression measures based on simple

	procedure offered by Affymetrix. Recently, physical models based
	on molecular hybridization theory have been proposed as useful tools
	for prediction of, for example, nonspecific hybridization. These
	physical models show great potential in terms of improving existing
	expression measures. In this paper, we suggest that the system producing
	the measured intensities is too complex to be fully described with
	these relatively simple physical models, and we propose empirically
	motivated stochastic models that complement the above-mentioned molecular
	hybridization theory to provide a comprehensive description of the

	the fundamentals of proteomic analyses as well as recent developments
	in the areas of separation methods, instrumentation, and overall
	experimental design. We highlight both the inherent strengths and
	limitations of protein MS and offer a rough guide for selecting an
	experimental design based on the goals of the analysis. We emphasize
	the versatility of the Orbitrap, a novel mass analyzer that features
	high resolution (up to 150,000), high mass accuracy (2-5 ppm), a
	mass-to-charge range of 6000, and a dynamic range greater than 10(3).
	High mass accuracy of the Orbitrap expands the arsenal of the data
	acquisition and analysis approaches compared with a low-resolution
	instrument. We discuss various chromatographic techniques, including
	multidimensional separation and ultra-performance liquid chromatography.
	Multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) involves
	a continuum sample preparation, orthogonal separations, and MS and
	software solutions. We discuss several aspects of MudPIT applications
	to quantitative phosphoproteomics. MudPIT application to large-scale
	analysis of phosphoproteins includes (a) a fractionation procedure
	for motif-specific enrichment of phosphopeptides, (b) development
	of informatics tools for interrogation and validation of shotgun
	phosphopeptide data, and (c) in-depth data analysis for simultaneous
	determination of protein expression and phosphorylation levels, analog
	to western blot measurements. We illustrate MudPIT application to
	quantitative phosphoproteomics of the beta adrenergic pathway. We
	discuss several biological discoveries made via mass spectrometry
