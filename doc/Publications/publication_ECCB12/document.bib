	molecules that regulate gene expression by binding directly to the
	messenger RNA of protein coding genes. They have been found to confer
	a novel layer of genetic regulation in a wide range of biological
	processes. Computational miRNA target prediction remains one of the
	key means used to decipher the role of miRNAs in development and
	disease. Here we introduce the basic idea behind the experimental
	identification of miRNA targets and present some of the most widely
	used computational miRNA target identification programs. The review

	22 nt), can bind to one or more target sites on a gene transcript
	to negatively regulate protein expression, subsequently controlling
	many cellular mechanisms. A current and curated collection of miRNA-target
	interactions (MTIs) with experimental support is essential to thoroughly
	elucidating miRNA functions under different conditions and in different
	species. As a database, miRTarBase has accumulated more than 3500
	MTIs by manually surveying pertinent literature after data mining
	of the text systematically to filter research articles related to
	functional studies of miRNAs. Generally, the collected MTIs are validated
	experimentally by reporter assays, western blot, or microarray experiments
	with overexpression or knockdown of miRNAs. miRTarBase curates 3576
	experimentally verified MTIs between 657 miRNAs and 2297 target genes
	among 17 species. miRTarBase contains the largest amount of validated
	MTIs by comparing with other similar, previously developed databases.
	The MTIs collected in the miRTarBase can also provide a large amount
	of positive samples to develop computational methods capable of identifying
	miRNA-target interactions. miRTarBase is now available on http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/,
	and is updated frequently by continuously surveying research articles.},

	at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available

	1300 experimentally supported targets. Each target site is described
	by the miRNA that binds it, the gene in which it occurs, the nature
	of the experiments that were conducted to test it, the sufficiency
	of the site to induce translational repression and/or cleavage, and
	the paper from which all these data were extracted. Additionally,
